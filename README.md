# BB's fork of suckless dwm

> Dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocle and floating layouts. All of the layouts can be applied dynamically, optimising the environment for the application in use and the task performed.

The upstream can be found at `https://git.suckless.org/dwm`.

## Patches

The patches I applied can be found in the `\patches\` folder.

## Configuration

The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
